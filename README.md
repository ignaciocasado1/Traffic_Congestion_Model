# Traffic_Congestion_Model

This project aims to build a regression model capable of predicting traffic congestion levels in 40 European cities. The model will take into account various factors such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and special events, among others, to provide accurate congestion level predictions.

## Data Sources
The data used for this project will be collected from multiple sources, including publicly available traffic data, weather data, and other values. The cities selected for this project will be some of the most heavily trafficked cities in Europe.

## Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the regression model, it will be preprocessed to ensure that it is clean and relevant. This will involve removing any missing or irrelevant data points and transforming the data into a format that is suitable for the model.

## Model Selection
For this project, we will be using a XGBoost regressior. This model has proven to be effective for predicting traffic congestion levels in other similar projects. Other models will also be evaluated to ensure that the selected model provides the most accurate predictions.

## Model Evaluation
The regression model's performance will be evaluated using standard metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics will help us determine the model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting traffic congestion levels.

## Results
The results of this project will be a regression model that can accurately predict traffic congestion levels in 40 European cities. The model's predictions can be used to inform traffic management decisions and help reduce congestion in these cities.

## Conclusion
This project aims to build a regression model that can predict traffic congestion levels in 40 European cities. The model will take into account various factors such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and special events, among others, to provide accurate congestion level predictions. The results of this project will have practical implications for traffic management and help reduce congestion in these cities.
